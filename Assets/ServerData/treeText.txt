TREE TOWNMAGE1
Something is clouding my magic ability.  It seems the other mages are also feeling weeker.  Please, seek out the cause of this and let us all know.  I fear, it cannot be good.

It's.. it's getting closer.  I can feel it.  My powers have faded, and I cannot tell what it is.  I do feel it strongest in the waste lands.  But, it is getting ever closer.
